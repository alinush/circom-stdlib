# Compilation-only tests

`circom` is still in its early days.

This directory contains `circom` stubs that call our templates to ensure they _at least_ compile.

**Note:** We cannot _easily_ test for correctness. We'd need to rely on external tools like `circomkit` or `circom_tester`.

In the future, we will and, in the process, eliminate these compilation-only tests.
